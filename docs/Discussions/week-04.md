# Week 4 - Egoism, Altruism, and the Social Contract

Instead of the typical LO questions, I want you to play the game that is below. Record your responses, for instance, say what the scenario was (homeless drug addict vs. millionaire etc). After each scenario, there is a blurb that displays below saying the number of people who also made the same or alternate choice as you. Make sure that you also record this in your homework response.
