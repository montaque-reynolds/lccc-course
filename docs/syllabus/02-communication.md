# Communication

Discord and email are my preferred methods of communication. I am on Discord during workday hours, though I may be “away” during meetings and while I attend to other business. I also may have limited availability between 8-4:30pm. I will also monitor Discord during weekday evening hours and will respond to messages if I am able. Likewise, I dedicate time to email responses each workday, meaning that my response time is typically within 24 hours during the workweek. Please use your LC email account when emailing me. For both email and Discord, if you have not received a response from me after 48 hours (or by end of business on Monday if you messaged me over the weekend), please follow-up to ensure that your message did not get
lost in the shuffle.

All messages regarding course updates, assignments, and changes to the class schedule, including cancellations, will be posted on the _news channel in Discord and in Blackboard. Changes to the class schedule, including cancellations, will also sent to your LC email account. It is imperative that you check both Discord and your lc email account regularly.

Please also ensure that all concerns or questions about your standing in the course are directed to me immediately. Inquires from parents, SLU staff members, and others will not be honored.

### Office Hours

You do not need an appointment to contact me during office hours. Please just message me on Discord or send me an email at mfreynolds@lc.edu, or montaque.reynolds@slu.edu questions, clarify lecture or readings, or just to chat. In addition to the posted office hours, you can make an appointment with me. (Just email me or talk with me before or after class to set it
up.) Outside of office hours, you can always stop by my office, but while I will try to be there and available, I can’t guarantee that I will be able to meet with you. It never hurts to try, but I may ask to schedule a meeting at another time. You can of course always contact me by email.

### Official Communications

I will from time to time wish to communicate with you outside of class hours with important class related information. I will use your school-supplied email. Because these communications are important, I expect that you will check (and read!) your email at least once a day, Monday through Friday.

### Email

The best way to reach me is by email. I will do my best to respond to emails in a timely manner— usually within 24 hours—but I will probably not answer emails between 5pm and 9am and on weekends. I am much more likely to answer emails during weekdays. Please remember that
email communications are a type of formal communication. You should always feel free to email me, but you should not treat an email to me like texting. As is the case with any formal commu-
nication, your email should contain a greeting—like “Dear Professor Reynolds,” or “Monty,”—a fully explained description of what you are trying to inform me of or ask me about, an ending with at least your first and last name, and an informative subject line beginning with the Course, number and semester, e.g., PHI 240 Fall. I’m not asking you to be overly formal, but simply to observe some commonly expected norms of communication. As you no doubt already know, this is how formal communication—in academics and in “the real world”—works.
