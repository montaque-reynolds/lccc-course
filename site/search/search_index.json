Phil 1700 invites students to explore enduring philosophical questions and to reflectively evaluate the various answers given them by thinkers from a range of social, historical, and religious contexts. Students will tackle ultimate questions in a range of philosophical domains, including issues such as the nature of self and ultimate reality, morality and human meaning, rationality and the pursuit of truth. The aim of the course is to give students an opportunity to critically examine their own beliefs and commitments in dialogue with each other and with great thinkers past and present.

What this means, is that instead of applying what have learned in the classroom at home, working on a problem, writing a paper, etc., you will instead apply what you have learned at home, in the classroom. This is an effective way to learn the information because you are getting a chance to apply it right away. I will provide ample opportunity for you to apply in class what you have learned at home. This includes assignments, discussion participation, reading feedback (i.e., this reading was difficult because . . .). Each of these aspects will together comprise your grade in the course. Ultimately, what you learn, and the grade you will receive, will be up to you. You will get as much out of this course as you put in.</p> <p>Both attendance and participation are critically important aspects of this class. Just as important however, is reading the material and take notes! The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during discussions and group exercises, \u00a9 level of engagement on discord, and (d) the completion of other exercises.</p> <p>Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit.

If you take notes on your computer, then you can have it open. However for this course, I will expect you to take notes by hand. For this class, I expect students to limit their use of electronic devices to accessing course software, readings, and notes. There is evidence that using electronic devices during lectures results in decreased retention of course content (Hembrooke and Gay 2003) and lower overall course performance (Fried 2008). Students who are not using a laptop but are in direct view of another student\u2019s laptop also have decreased performance in courses (Sana et al. 2013). Conversely, students who take notes the \u201cold fashioned way\u201d have better performance on tests compared to students who take notes on laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). I therefore ask students to be conscious of how they are using their devices, the ways such use impacts their own learning, and the effect that it may have on others around them.
